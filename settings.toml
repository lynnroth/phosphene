# Phosphene board settings — SAMPLE FILE
#
# This file documents all available settings for gateway and endpoint boards.
# To use: copy the relevant section to CIRCUITPY/settings.toml on each board
# and fill in your real values. The per-board files in gateway/ and endpoint/
# are gitignored so credentials stay off the repo.
#
# WARNING: Do NOT add CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID, CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD, or
# CIRCUITPY_WEB_API_PASSWORD to your board's settings.toml — those activate
# CircuitPython's built-in web workflow, which makes the CIRCUITPY drive
# read-only over USB.
